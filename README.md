# divelog2srt

Create deep subtitles from you dive computer regarding media recording under water

# Requirements

`ffmpeg`/`ffprobe` and `python3` should be installed on your computer.

Your videos should need to be recognized by ffprobe (which means quite all formats).

The dive log format supported right now is one from [SubSurface](https://subsurface-divelog.org).
